## User identification

Web-user identification is a hot topic of research on the brink of sequential pattern mining and behavioural psychology.

The data is loaded from Blaise Pascal University proxy servers. Paper "A Tool for Classification of Sequential Data" by Giacomo Kahn, Yannick Loiseau and Olivier Raynaud. 

Raw data contains a dataset of web navigation logs from more than 3,000 users over a six-month period.

## The aim is to identify pattern of user behaviour (normal/not normal, hacked) based on Internet tracking his/her sequence of attended Web pages.
